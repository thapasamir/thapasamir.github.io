# How to choose your first programming language and why ?

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/700/0*EHUqkOXku7A7Izcz)

A programming language is not only a programming language. Its a philosophy about thoughts and ideas; and its a community of people who believe in those thoughts and ideas. Sure as someone who is just starting out, it may be a good idea to learn the most popular programming language. But once you are fairly knowledgeable in the language, its a good idea to pick something else. Before picking up a programming language to learn get a feel of the people who work in the language. The quirks of the programming language will be manifested by how the people behave.

# Okay ! Firstly let,s start with what is programming language ?

A programming language is a set of rules and syntax for writing computer programs. It is a way for humans to communicate instructions to a computer in a way that the computer can understand and execute. There are many different programming languages, each with their own set of rules and syntax. Some examples of programming languages include C, C++, Java, Python, and Lisp. Each programming language has its own unique features and is used for different purposes. For example, C and C++ are high-performance languages that are often used for operating systems and other low-level applications, while Java and Python are high-level languages that are easier for humans to read and write, and are often used for web development and data analysis.

# What is Programming Paradigm ?

A programming paradigm is a style or approach to organizing and writing code. It is a way of thinking about the structure and behavior of a computer program. Different programming paradigms have different characteristics and trade-offs, and can be more or less suited to different types of problems.

Some common programming paradigms include imperative programming, object-oriented programming, functional programming, logic programming, and procedural programming. Each paradigm has its own set of concepts, techniques, and approaches to organizing code, and different programming languages may support one or more paradigms.

By using a particular programming paradigm, developers can take advantage of its specific features and benefits to solve problems in an efficient and effective way. For example, object-oriented programming is often used for building complex software systems because it allows developers to model real-world concepts and relationships in a natural way, while functional programming is well-suited to concurrent and parallel programming because it avoids changing state.

## Some of the most popular paradigms include:

1.  Imperative programming: This paradigm focuses on describing how a program should operate by specifying a sequence of actions for the computer to perform. It is based on the idea of mutable state and includes languages such as C, C++, and Java.
2.  Object-oriented programming: This paradigm organizes code into “objects” that represent real-world entities and the actions that can be performed on them. It is based on the idea of encapsulation and includes languages such as Java, Python, and C#.
3.  Functional programming: This paradigm treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing state. It is based on the idea of immutability and includes languages such as Lisp, Haskell, and ML.
4.  Procedural programming: This paradigm organizes code into procedures, or small subroutines that perform specific tasks. It is based on the idea of modularity and includes languages such as C and Pascal.

## Funny programming Languages:

Here are a few examples of humorous programming languages, along with a short example program in each language:

1.  BrainFuck: BrainFuck is an esoteric programming language that was created in 1993 as a joke. It is known for its extremely minimalistic syntax, which consists of only eight commands.

Here is an example program in BrainFuck that prints “Hello, World!” to the console:

``` 
++++++++++[>+++++++>++++++++++>+++>+<<<<-]>++.>+.+++++++..+++.>++.<<+++++++++++++++.>.+++. — — — . — — — — .>+.>. 
```

2. Moo is an esoteric programming language that was created as a joke. It is based on the concept of a “mooing” interpreter, which “interprets” programs by mooing the output. Here is an example program in Moo that prints “Hello, World!” to the console:

```
MOO “Hello, World!”
```
3. Bhailang is dynamically typed toy programming language, based on an inside joke, written in Typescript. Example of bhailang
```typescript
 jab tak bhai (b < 5) {  
    bol bhai b;  
  
    agar bhai (b == a) {  
      bol bhai "b is equal to a";  
    } nahi to bhai (b == 0) {  
      bol bhai "b is equal to zero";  
    }  
  
    b += 1;  
  }  
bye bhai
```
